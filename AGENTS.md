# AGENTS.md

## Scope

- Applies to the full repository.

## Start Here

- Read README.md for quick start and project status.
- Read CONTEXT.md for constraints and success criteria.
- Read TODO.md for active priorities.
- Read DECISIONS.md for non-obvious rationale.

## Working Rules

- Keep edits small and focused on the requested task.
- Update TODO.md when task state changes.
- Update DECISIONS.md for non-obvious decisions.
- Run ./scripts/test.sh before concluding meaningful changes.

## POC Guardrails

- Optimize for fast learning and demoable outcomes over completeness.
- Keep artifacts lightweight; avoid heavy process docs that will go stale.
- Prefer executable truth in scripts over narrative setup/test instructions.
- Keep README operational: run path, current status, and immediate caveats.
- Keep TODO flat and atomic; avoid hierarchy and process overhead.
- Record only non-obvious decisions; keep entries concise.

## Upgrade Triggers

- Propose moving to OpenSpec/Spec Kit when work becomes phased, multi-team, or contract-heavy.
- Propose moving to OpenSpec/Spec Kit when production hardening needs explicit planning/governance artifacts.

# Current Development State

**Last Task Completed (27 Feb 2025):**
Enhanced PLAN.md with task status indicators:
- Added [x], [!], [] notation for completed, problematic, and not started tasks
- Added a Status Indicators section explaining the notation
- Applied status indicators to existing goals, requirements, and tasks
- Marked appropriate items as completed or problematic based on current state

**Current Status:**
Project structure remains minimized to essentials. PLAN.md now provides clearer visual indication of progress and areas needing attention. Ready for testing with a simple implementation task.

**Known Issues:**
None

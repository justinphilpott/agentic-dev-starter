# Current Development State

## Completed Task
- Added TLDR section to README.md
- Updated Getting Started section to mention users can either use this repo or copy files to their own project
- Moved the prompt from README.md to its own file (PROMPT.md)
- Moved "Getting Started" section further up in README.md (after "The Files" section)
- Improved tone and conciseness throughout README.md

## Current Project Status
- Developed three alternative prompt approaches
- Selected and integrated ultra-minimal prompt style into README.md
- Confirmed MIT License is appropriate for the project
- Updated PLAN.md with completed tasks and next steps
- Improved documentation with TLDR and clearer Getting Started instructions
- Reorganized content by moving prompt to dedicated PROMPT.md file
- Enhanced README.md structure with more logical flow and improved readability

## Known Issues or Limitations
- Need to test if ultra-minimal approach maintains sufficient context in practice
- May need to adjust response style protocol based on real-world usage

# Current Development State

**Last Task Completed (27 Feb 2025):**
Enhanced project documentation for better protocol adherence:
- Enhanced PLAN.md with task status indicators ([x], [!], [])
- Improved the prompt in README.md with stronger emphasis on mandatory protocols
- Added visual cues (emojis, checkmarks, warnings) to make protocols more noticeable
- Added explicit warnings about not proceeding until protocols are completed

**Current Status:**
Project structure remains minimized to essentials. PLAN.md now provides clearer visual indication of progress and areas needing attention. The prompt has been strengthened to ensure protocols are followed consistently. Ready for testing with a simple implementation task.

**Known Issues:**
None

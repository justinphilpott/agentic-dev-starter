# Current Development State

## Completed Task
Created two versions of refined prompts focusing on reducing verbosity:
1. refined_prompt.md - More concise structure but same interaction pattern
2. refined_prompt_v2.md - Fundamentally changes interaction style to be minimal while maintaining protocol benefits

## Current Project Status
- Created index.js with square calculation function (unintentionally)
- Developed two alternative prompt approaches
- Updated PLAN.md with completed task and next steps

## Known Issues or Limitations
- Refined prompts need user review before integration into README.md
- Need to test if the minimalist approach maintains sufficient context for development continuity

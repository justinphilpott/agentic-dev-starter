# Current Development State

**Last Task Completed (27 Feb 2025):**
Refined project documentation and protocols:
- Enhanced PLAN.md with task status indicators ([x], [!], [])
- Improved the prompt in README.md with stronger emphasis on mandatory protocols
- Refined task start protocol to focus on presenting next steps and seeking confirmation
- Updated git commit format to follow conventional commits style
- Enhanced plan review guidance to be more comprehensive

**Current Status:**
Project structure remains minimized to essentials. PLAN.md now provides clearer visual indication of progress and areas needing attention. The prompt has been significantly strengthened to ensure protocols are followed consistently and to improve user-AI collaboration. Ready for testing with a simple implementation task.

**Known Issues:**
None

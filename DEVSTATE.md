# Current Development State

## Completed Task
Created three versions of refined prompts with increasing focus on minimizing verbosity:
1. refined_prompt.md - More concise structure
2. refined_prompt_v2.md - Minimalist interaction style
3. refined_prompt_v3.md - Ultra-minimal approach with extreme brevity

## Current Project Status
- Created index.js with square calculation function
- Developed three alternative prompt approaches
- Updated PLAN.md with completed task and next steps

## Known Issues or Limitations
- Need to select preferred prompt style and integrate into README.md
- Need to test if ultra-minimal approach maintains sufficient context

# Current Development State

## Completed Task
Evaluated and refined the prompt in the README.md file to make the task start protocol less verbose. Created a refined version in refined_prompt.md that is approximately 40% shorter while maintaining all essential functionality.

## Current Project Status
- Created index.js with a function to calculate the square of a number (unintentionally, as part of initial confusion about which task to work on)
- Created refined_prompt.md with a more concise version of the development protocols
- Updated PLAN.md to mark the evaluation task as in progress/needing attention

## Known Issues or Limitations
- The refined prompt needs to be reviewed by the user to ensure it meets their expectations
- The refined prompt has not yet been integrated into the README.md file
- The JavaScript function task was started but was not the intended focus of this session

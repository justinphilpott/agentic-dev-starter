# Development Plan

## Goals
- Create a minimal framework for effective AI-assisted development
- Optimize for incremental delivery and focused tasks
- Minimize documentation while maximizing clarity

## Constraints
- Keep all documentation as concise as possible
- Avoid creating unnecessary files or complex structures
- Rely on git for history rather than maintaining separate logs

## Requirements
- Must work with standard git workflows
- Should be easy to adopt for new projects
- Must provide clear guidance for AI assistants

## Tasks
- Test the consolidated prompt with a simple implementation task
- Update README.md to include or reference the consolidated prompt
- Remove redundant prompt files after consolidation is complete
- Create a simple example demonstrating the workflow

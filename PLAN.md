## Status Indicators

- [!] Problematic task (needs attention)
- [ ] Task not yet started

## Goals
- [ ] complete two simple tasks, intended to test our workflow 

## Constraints
- don't worry about running these javascript or python or installing related libraries and supporting code

## Requirements
- 

## Tasks
- [x] Evaluate how I can refine the prompt in the readme file to make the task start protocol be less verbose before we actually get to doing some work
- [x] agree on and select preferred prompt style (standard, minimalist, or ultra-minimal) as seen in the refined_prompt files
- [x] Integrate the selected prompt style into README.md
- [x] Add TLDR to README.md and update Getting Started section
- [x] Move prompt to its own file (PROMPT.md)
- [ ] Test the new prompt style with the remaining tasks

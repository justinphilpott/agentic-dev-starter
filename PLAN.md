## Status Indicators
- [x] Completed task
- [!] Problematic task (needs attention)
- [ ] Task not yet started

## Goals
- [ ] complete two simple tasks, intended to test our workflow 

## Constraints
- don't worry about running these javascript or python or installing related libraries and supporting code

## Requirements
- 

## Tasks
- [ ] Write a function in javascript in an index.js file to calculate the square of a given number
- [ ] Write a function in python to calculate the volume of a sphere of given radius
- [x] Evaluate how I can refine the prompt in the readme file to make the task start protocol be less verbose before we actually get to doing some work
- [ ] Review and select preferred prompt style (standard, minimalist, or ultra-minimal)
- [ ] Integrate the selected prompt style into README.md
- [ ] Test the new prompt style with the remaining tasks

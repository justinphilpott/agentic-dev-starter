# TODO

## BLOCKERS

- NONE

## Doing Now

- [ ] Run the upgrade skill against one external legacy POC repo and capture migration notes.
- [ ] Add a non-interactive flags mode to `scripts/new-poc.sh` for automation use cases.

## Next Up

- [ ] Add a short migration example in the root README that links to the upgrade skill.
- [ ] Validate generated templates against 2-3 different tech stacks.

## Maybe Later

- [ ] Add a lightweight `audit` command to detect drift from canonical files.
- [ ] Publish the upgrade skill for reuse outside this repository.

## Done (recent)

- ~~[ ] Reworked repo into a CLI-first POC scaffold kit~~
- ~~[ ] Added `scripts/new-poc.sh` interactive generator~~
- ~~[ ] Added `skills/poc-upgrade-existing` migration skill~~

## Won't Do (this iteration)

- Full project governance features intended for long-running phased initiatives.

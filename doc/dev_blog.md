## 27 February 2025 - README.md Completion

### Progress
- Completed the README.md file for the Agentic Dev Starter project
- Added a proper "Contents" section with links to all major sections
- Created a "Getting Started" section with installation and setup instructions
- Added a "Usage Example" section demonstrating the workflow
- Ensured all sections are properly formatted and consistent

### Current Status
The README.md now provides comprehensive documentation for the Agentic Dev Starter framework, including:
- Clear explanation of the purpose and problem being solved
- Detailed description of the solution and required files
- Step-by-step instructions for getting started
- A practical usage example showing the workflow in action

### Next Steps
1. Test the framework with a simple implementation task as mentioned in PLAN.md
2. Consider creating a simple demo repository that showcases the framework in action
3. Potentially add diagrams or visuals to illustrate the workflow
4. Explore integration with other AI assistants beyond Claude
5. Gather feedback from users and iterate on the framework

### Continuation Prompt
"Now that we've completed the README.md, let's test the framework with a simple implementation task as mentioned in PLAN.md. What kind of simple example would best demonstrate the workflow?"

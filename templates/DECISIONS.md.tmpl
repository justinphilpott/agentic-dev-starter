# Architectural Decisions

## Format

Each decision follows this structure:

- **Decision**: [Brief title]
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Status**: [Active | Superseded | Experimental]
- **Context**: [What forces led to this decision?]
- **Decision**: [What did we decide?]
- **Consequences**: [Tradeoffs, benefits, costs]
- **Alternatives Considered**: [What else was evaluated?]

## Decisions

### EXAMPLE - DELETE AFTER FIRST REAL DECISION

**Decision**: Document architectural choices in structured format
**Date**: {{.Date}}
**Status**: Active
**Context**: During rapid POC development, the rationale behind decisions is easily forgotten. Future contributors (including LLM agents) need context to avoid revisiting settled questions.
**Decision**: Use this DECISIONS.md file to document all non-obvious architectural choices with context, consequences, and alternatives considered.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear record of "why" behind architecture
- ✅ Helps agents understand constraints before making changes
- ⚠️ Requires discipline to update when making significant decisions
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Code comments only (too scattered, hard to find)
- Wiki/external docs (disconnected from code, easy to forget){{if .IncludeLearnings}}
**Related Learning**: See [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) > Documentation Patterns{{end}}

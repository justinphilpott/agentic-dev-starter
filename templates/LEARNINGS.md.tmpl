Capture discoveries as you build. Focus on what you validated, not just opinions.

### EXAMPLE - DELETE AFTER FIRST REAL LEARNING

**Topic**: Documentation Patterns

**What**: Topic-based organization beats chronological for quick reference

**Impact**: Faster to find relevant context when making decisions

[Add your learnings grouped by topic - e.g., Architecture, Performance, UX]

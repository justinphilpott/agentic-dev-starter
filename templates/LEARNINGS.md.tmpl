# Learnings

Validated discoveries from building {{.ProjectName}}, organized by topic.

**Important**: Only record learnings that have been validated through experimentation or real usage. This is not a place for opinions or untested ideas.

## Format

Each learning entry includes:
- **Learning**: [What we discovered]
- **Validation**: [How we confirmed this - experiments, user testing, measurements]
- **Impact**: [How this affects the project]
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## EXAMPLE - DELETE AFTER FIRST REAL LEARNING

### Development Workflow

**Learning**: Structuring learnings by topic makes them easier to find than chronological order
**Validation**: Example entry demonstrates the format. Delete this once you add real learnings.
**Impact**: When making decisions, you can quickly scan relevant topic sections instead of reading through a timeline.
**Date**: {{.Date}}

‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES WITHOUT EXCEPTION FOR EVERY TASK ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üîÑ TASK START PROTOCOL

1. Read CONTEXT.md in order to understand the context of the current project. Ensure that you follow any directives in that file.
2. Read DEVLOG.md which will provide an overview of the progression of this project. 

## üìã DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

1. MINIMIZE CODE: Make sure that you do not write a solution for some problem for which there may already be an existing accepted solution/library. 
2. NARROW SCOPE: Build minimum viable solutions, avoid taking optimization tangents and stay focused on completing atomic tasks.
3. SIMPLIFY: Choose straightforward approaches
4. INCREMENTAL: Deliver in small, independent units
5. CHALLENGE: Question if >20 lines of code are needed
6. COMPLETE: Focus on finishing rather than future-proofing

## üèÅ SESSION COMPLETION PROTOCOL

‚õî IF YOU HAVE CHANGED ANY FILES IN THIS SESSION, YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING ‚õî

1. **Update DEVLOG.md**: you must add a new entry at the top of the history section summarising your actions during this session. Ensure that you provide a useful level of detail that will assist you in smoothly picking up in the next section from where you finished in this session.
2. **Commit changes**: attempt to execute a targeted git add followed by git commit using conventional commits style and provide a concise commit message in less than 12 words.
